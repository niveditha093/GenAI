        ">The \"Cuisine Companion: A Recipe Recommendation System Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI Embeddings\" project delves into the practical implementation of an innovative approach to recipe recommendation. Leveraging the power of modern embedding models, specifically the text-embedding-3-small model, and integrating it into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this project aims to enhance the process of suggesting recipes to users based on their preferences and available ingredients.\n",

        "\n",
        ">The foundation of this system is built upon the vast collection of Indian dessert recipes sourced from the dataset provided by Hugging Face's repository (/VishalMysore/indiandesert). By harnessing MongoDB's Vector Database, the project enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of recipe data, facilitating seamless interaction with the recommendation system.\n",

By combining retrieval techniques with generation models, users can expect personalized and contextually relevant recipe recommendations tailored to their preferences and culinary requirements.\n",
